Russian language module for Babel package for LaTeX system of typesetting
=========================================================================
----------------------------------------------------------------

Russian language module for Babel, v1.3j

Released under the LaTeX Project Public License v1.3c or later.
See http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt

The package provides support for use of Babel in documents written in Russian
(in both traditional and ancient forms). The support is adapted for use both
under legacy TEX engines, and under XâˆƒTEX and LuaTEX.

The Current Maintainer is Igor A. Kotelnikov <kia999 at mail dot ru>.

1. INSTALLATION

- unpack babel-russian.zip
- run "xelatex.exe russianb.dtx" (recommended)
  or "pdflatex.exe russianb.dtx";
  run "tex.exe russianb.dtx"
  or "tex.exe russianb.ins", if you don't need documentation
- move "russianb.ldf" to <textmf>/tex/generic/babel/contrib/
- move "russianb.pdf" and README to <textmf>/doc/latex/russian-babel/
- update filename base (see documentation for your TeX system)

2. USAGE

Russian language definition file can be used both with legacy 8-bit engines
(such as latex.exe or pdflatex.exe) and Unicode compilers (xelatex.exe or
lualatex.exe). The Unicode engines can be ran either in Unicode mode or 8-bit
compatibility mode, which emulates the legacy engines. The two modes differ by
a set of packages loaded in the preamble of a source TeX file. It is important
to keep recommended order of the packages loaded, especially when running
Unicode engines in a compatibility 8-bit mode.

In the examples below, it is assumed that a source file has utf8 input encoding.

2.1. 8-bit mode

2.1.1 PDFLATeX, LaTeX

    \usepackage[T1,T2A]{fontenc}
    \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
    \usepackage[english,russian]{babel}

2.1.2 LuaLaTeX

    \usepackage[T1,T2A]{fontenc}
    \usepackage[lutf8]{luainputenc}
    \usepackage[english,russian]{babel}

2.1.3 XeLaTeX

    \XeTeXinputencoding "bytes"
    \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
    \usepackage[T2A]{fontenc}
    \usepackage[english,russian]{babel}

2.2 Unicode mode, LuaLaTeX or XeLaTeX

    \usepackage{fontspec}
        \defaultfontfeatures{Ligatures={TeX}}
        \setmainfont{CMU Serif}
        \setsansfont{CMU Sans Serif}
        \setmonofont{CMU Typewriter Text}
    \usepackage[english,russian]{babel}

Instead of the Computer Modern Unicode (CMU) fonts loaded in this example,
you may try any True Type or Open Type font installed on your computer provided
that that font came with Russian letters.

2.3 Typesetting ancient book

    \usepackage[english,russian]{babel}
    \languageattribute{russian}{ancient}
or
    \usepackage[english,russian.ancient]{babel}

Using Unicode mode is strongly recommended for typesetting ancient texts.
Be sure to take X2 or OT2 font encodings when running 8-bit engine such
as latex or pdflatex.

3. DOCUMENTATION

See russianb.pdf for more information.

4. KNOWN PROBLEMS

Before switching from a legacy 8-bit engine (tex, pdftex) to an Unicode
engine (xetex, luatex) and vise versa delete all .aux, .toc, .lot, .lof
files as they might have stored incompatible internal encodings.

T2* font encodings do not have legacy Cyrillic letters `yat', which is
hard-coded in ancient caption names. Be sure to use an Unicode engine
or borrow `\cyryat` and `\CYRYAT` commands from X2 font encoding when setting
the language attribute to "ancient", for example:

    \usepackage[X2,T2A]{fontenc}
    \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
    \DeclareUnicodeCharacter{0462}{\CYRYAT}
    \DeclareTextSymbolDefault{\CYRYAT}{X2}
    \DeclareUnicodeCharacter{0463}{\cyryat}
    \DeclareTextSymbolDefault{\cyryat}{X2}
    \usepackage[english,russian.ancient]{babel}

Consult your font documentation for other ancient glyphs which
might be absent.
